# MediTrack Application Specification

## Overview
MediTrack is a local web application designed to run in a user's web browser. Its primary goal is to monitor the user's medication intake based on their input and analyze their Apple Health data, collected from an Apple Watch, to identify trends and correlations. The application will leverage the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API to retrieve medication information, as well as provide relevant health data analysis. MediTrack will store the user's information locally and utilize the user's computer hardware and network connection for processing and functionality.

## Features and Functionality

### User Authentication and API Key Input
1. The application should provide a user authentication system, allowing users to log in with their credentials.
2. Once logged in, the user should be prompted to input their OpenAI API key, which will be used to access the GPT-3.5 API.

### Medication Management
1. The application should allow the user to input details of their medications, including:
   - Medication name (text input)
   - Dosage (numeric input)
   - Frequency (numeric input or predefined options)
   - Time of intake (optional: time picker)
2. The application should validate the input and display appropriate error messages for any invalid or missing fields.
3. the application should be personalized to every user (the user needs to be able to store information about themselves inside the application such as age, gender, height, weight, demographic information)  The application will use this personalization to provide a unique and custom visit tailored to each user.

### Medication Information Retrieval
1. Upon medication input, the application should make a request to the GPT-3.5 API to retrieve detailed information about the medication, including:
   - Drug name
   - Dosage instructions
   - Possible side effects and likelihood based on user's demographic
   - Drug interactions with current regimen
   - Relevant precautions
   - Interactive withdrawal timeline that considers the user's specific regimine and information
   - How long the medication takes to work
   - Duration of use for each medicine
- 

### Apple Health Data Integration
1. The application should access the user's Apple Health data collected by an Apple Watch. Include the following metrics in the integration:
   - Heart rate (resting and active)
   - Blood pressure
   - Respiratory rate
   - Sleep analysis (duration, quality, and stages)
   - Steps count
   - Distance traveled
   - Active energy expenditure
   - Exercise duration and type
   - ECG data (if available)
   - Any other relevant health metrics available through the Apple Health API

### Correlation Analysis
1. The application should correlate the user's medication intake data with their Apple Health metrics to identify trends and correlations.
2. Implement proprietary (you must create them) appropriate algorithms to analyze the data, such as statistical method to determine correlations between medication intake and health metrics.

### Visualization and Reporting
1. The application should provide visualizations and reports to present the correlation analysis results to the user.
2. Display trends, correlations, and insights using charts, graphs, or other visual representations.
3. Allow users to filter and customize the displayed information based on specific medications, time periods, or health metrics of interest.

## Privacy and Security Considerations
1. Ensure that the user's OpenAI API key and any personal health data are securely stored and transmitted.

## Hardware and Network Requirements
1. The application should utilize the user's computer hardware resources for processing and running the application efficiently.
2. Utilize the user's network connection to communicate with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API and retrieve medication information as needed.
